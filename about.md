Second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at University of Alberta.
I'm interested in machine learning and it's applications on robotics perception and control.

I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology where I was a member of [Innovation Center of Electronics](http://sti.hust.edu.cn/), now part of [Qiming College](http://qiming.hust.edu.cn/). I hold a Master Degree in Electrical Engineering at [Dalhousie University](http://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical.html) and in Computer Science at University of Alberta.
